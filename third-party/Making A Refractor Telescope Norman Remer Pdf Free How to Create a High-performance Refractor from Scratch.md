## Why You Should Make Your Own Refractor Telescope
 
Making your own refractor telescope can be a rewarding and educational experience. You will not only gain a deeper understanding of how telescopes work, but also develop valuable skills in optics, mechanics, and engineering. You will also have the satisfaction of creating something unique and personalized that you can use to explore the wonders of the night sky.
 
Refractor telescopes have many advantages over other types of telescopes. They are easy to use, portable, low maintenance, and produce sharp and bright images. They are especially good for observing the moon, planets, double stars, and star clusters. They also have less optical errors than reflector telescopes, such as coma, astigmatism, and diffraction spikes.
 
### How to Get Started with Making Your Own Refractor Telescope
 
If you want to make your own refractor telescope, you will need some basic tools and materials, such as a hacksaw, a drill, a file, a ruler, a compass, some screws, some wood, some metal tubes, some paint, and some glue. You will also need two lenses: an objective lens and an eyepiece lens. The objective lens is the larger lens that collects the light from the object you are observing. The eyepiece lens is the smaller lens that magnifies the image formed by the objective lens.
 
You can buy lenses online or from optical shops, or you can make your own by grinding and polishing glass blanks. Making your own lenses is more challenging and time-consuming, but also more rewarding and cheaper. You will need some abrasive powders, some polishing compounds, some pitch, some glass blanks, and some templates. You can find detailed instructions on how to make your own lenses online or in books.
 
Once you have your lenses ready, you will need to mount them on the metal tubes and align them properly. You will also need to construct a wooden tube that will hold the metal tubes and provide stability and protection. You will also need to make some accessories for your telescope, such as a finder scope, a focuser, a diagonal mirror or prism, a mount, and a tripod. You can find detailed instructions on how to make these accessories online or in books.
